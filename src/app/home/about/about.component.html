                I love Aromatherapy and I love massage. Perfect!! Massage and aromatherapy are two very powerful healers, that will compliment
                any other treatment you are receiving. Aromatherapy is becoming the most increasing popular treatment of
                our age, due to our awareness and desire to eliminate chemicals, toxins and pharmaceuticals from our lives.
                This has us seeking alternatives.

                Essential oils active and highly concentrated secondary metabolites of plants. These unique constituents are used for defense
                and survival. Much like our hormone and immune responses. These constituents are medicines, bringing balance
                back to our minds, body and spirit. Now more than ever in Australia essential oils are becoming more readily
                available. They are being seen everywhere in so many applications. It is my desire and passion to help you
                to use them effectively in your life.

                The art and science of a clinical aromatherapist is in the selection and blending of a perfect healing synergy of essential
                oils. We consider safety guidelines and you as an individual. As a Clinical Aromatherapist I want share my
                knowledge, search and source quality essential oils, from small sustainable farms in Australia and the world.

                incorporate with a beautiful aromatherapy massage.
